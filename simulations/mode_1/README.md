# Mode 1 Simulation Data

This directory contains comprehensive simulation data for the Tennessee Eastman Challenge Process operating in Mode 1 conditions.

## Files Overview

### Normal Operations
- **`mode1_normal_50.xlsx`**: 50 hours of normal Mode 1 operations

#### Available Files
Each fault type has 5 simulation batches:
- `mode1_1_1.xlsx` through `mode1_1_5.xlsx` (Fault 1, Batches 1-5)
- `mode1_2_1.xlsx` through `mode1_2_5.xlsx` (Fault 2, Batches 1-5)
- ...
- `mode1_21_1.xlsx` through `mode1_21_5.xlsx` (Fault 21, Batches 1-5)

**Total**: 105 fault simulation files (21 faults Ã— 5 batches each)

## Data Structure

All Excel files contain time series data with columns typically including:
- **Time**: Simulation time stamps
- **Process Variables**: Temperatures, pressures, flow rates, compositions
- **Manipulated Variables**: Valve positions, controller setpoints
- **Measured Disturbances**: External disturbances affecting the process
- **Fault Indicators**: Flags indicating when faults are active (in fault scenarios)

## Usage Notes

- **Normal operation files** are ideal for establishing baseline behavior and training normal operation models
- **Fault scenario files** provide labeled data for fault detection and diagnosis algorithm development
- **Multiple batches** for each fault allow for statistical analysis and cross-validation
- **Mode 1 conditions** represent one of the standard operating points of the Tennessee Eastman process

## Applications

This dataset is particularly useful for:
- Developing and testing fault detection algorithms
- Training machine learning models for process monitoring
- Benchmarking process analytics methods
- Studying process dynamics and control system behavior
